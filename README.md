Percentage and Math Calculator
This is a Python program that can calculate various percentage and math problems. It includes options to calculate percentages, triangle measurements, and gravity/pressure values.

How to Use
To use this program, simply run the Start() function. You will then be prompted to choose a mode:

Percentages (mode 1)
Triangles (mode 2)
Gravity/Pressure (mode 3)
Percentages
If you choose mode 1, you will be prompted to choose a sub-mode:

Calculate percentage
Calculate with percentages
Calculate with percentage increase
Calculate with percentage decrease
Calculate percentage increase
Calculate percentage decrease
